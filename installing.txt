create 3 instance
change the user to "sudo su" command to root.
and then in the master instance you have to open ports: so we can open "ALL TCP for the instance you can give the instance name".
now we ahave to use command in every instance
now you can google kubernetes official documentation and search for install kubeadm.
search for container runtime and open it
then open IPv4 forwading and apply the command in all 3 instances.
then we enable the IPv4 forwarding in all the instances.
then apply the command "sudo swapoff -a" to stop the swap.
you can also check swap off by using "cat /etc/fstab"


Now we are going to install contained.
for this open the link  getting started with containerd
and go with option2 and open the ubuntu one.
and install docker by runing command one by one.
in the last command we only insatll container d by using the command "sudo apt-get install containerd.io"

after that we have to figure out about containerd so :
now we have to apply this command "containerd config default > /etc/containerd/config.toml" 
and we can check by using vi /etc/containerd/config.toml
and after that open this "containerd config default > /etc/containerd/config.toml"  file and scroll down and "systemdCgroup =true" in all 3 instances.


After all this we have to restart the containerd by using this command : "sudo systemctl restart contained"
and we can also check the status of conatinerd by using the command "sudo systemctl status contained.
<-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Now we are going to install the kubeadm, kubectl, and kubelet.
go to this page: https://v1-31.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/
now copy command one by one and install in the all instance
1. sudo apt-get update
2. sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gpg
3. curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
4. echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
5. sudo apt-get update
6. sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
7. sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl



<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
now we are going to apply all the command one by one again for install the kubeadm, kubectl, and kubelet.
Now last command we have apply :---------------------------------------------------------------------
"kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address 172.31.24.203 --pod-network-cidr 10.244.0.0/16 --cri-socket unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock"
--apiserver-advertise-address:   this we can find in page : "https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/"
172.31.24.203 this is master instance private IP
--pod-network-cidr  this we can find in :"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/" in the section of installing a pods networks add on.
10.244.0.0/16 this we can find " we have to search for addon and then go to that page look for flannel and open it then you can see the section for deploying flannel with kubectl.
--cri-socket this you can find on the page "https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/" under the section of Initializing your control-plane node  3 number.
unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock" and this you can find by clicking on this : "--cri-socket" you can find.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
after that terminal provide you some command you have to use first command you use as ubuntu user so you exit the root one
second command you have to use in worker1 and worker2 and check the status

<-----------------------------------you can check your version by running the command kubectl version --client --------------------------------->
after that you have to isnatll the plugin from wavenet :-----"kubectl apply -f https://reweave.azurewebsites.net/k8s/v1.29/net.yaml" ----- change the verion only you can find in the addon page.


<.................................................................secutity..............................>
for security we have to check our kubernetes cluster by running these command open this "https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit/releases" this is for to check any security checks
and search for " tar -xvzf kubeaudit_linux_amd64.tar.gz
and download this in master node through "wget tar -xvzf kubeaudit_linux_amd64.tar.gz"
then extract it " tar -xvzf filename"
then move this file to " sudo mv kubeaudit /usr/local/bin/
then apply the command "kubeaudit all"
